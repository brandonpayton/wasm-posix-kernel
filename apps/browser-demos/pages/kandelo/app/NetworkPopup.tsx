// Network popup — the exchange that connects two Kandelo computers.
//
// With a signalling server configured, the pair shares a session name and
// the server carries the codes: one side hosts the name, the other joins
// it. The manual exchange stays underneath it, because it is the one flow
// that needs nobody: the humans carry the codes, one side creates an
// invite, the other answers it, the first completes. Both codes are plain
// text so they travel through whatever chat window the two people already
// share.
